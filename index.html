                   Education-Birth Right 
                </p>
                <p class="text-small">Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world and the most effective way to break out of the cycle of poverty. Yet, after 70 years of Independence, over two crore children (NSS-2014) still remain out-of-school in India. These children are not only deprived of their right to receive an education but they lose their childhood to earn bread for a living.
       Government through its Right to Education Act, 2009 have been making its way in enrolling and retaining children in school especially from the marginalized sector. According to the National Survey for Estimation of Out-of-School Children conducted in 2014, more than 60% of children dropped out before completing 3rd grade and according to the Institute for Policy Research Studies (PRS), nearly 50% of students dropped out by 11th grade.  With the existence of such staggering numbers, the proper implementation of the Right to Education Act is yet to be made. </p>

        <p class="text-small sectionSubTag">Non-governmental organisations work at the grassroots level to help underprivileged children access quality education. India is a vast country with a huge demographic and geographic divide, and NGO’s play a key role in bringing people together. NGOs working for education in India, like Oxfam India, play an important role in supporting the most vulnerable children access their Right to Education through innovative ideas such as forming student groups and child-tracking system, holding awareness workshops with parents to ensure that they send children to school and form parent committees to esure that schools are run properly.When there is a major imbalance, NGOs exists to balance the see-saw. NGOs like Oxfam India play a significant role in ensuring that every child especially the poor receive the opportunity to build a better future through education. Many NGOs like Oxfam India, Save the Children, World Vision, UNICEF, Cry etc in India work at the grass-root level to strengthen the education system, spread awareness about the importance of education and enrol as many children as possible so they can thrive in life.</p>

            <p class="text-big sectionTag">Smile Care Foundation</p>
        <p class="text-small sectionSubTag">Smile Care Foundation, one of the top educational NGOs in India is reaching children through its education programme Mission Education. Mission Education, started in the year 2002 has so far benefitted more than 232,000 underprivileged children. Through more than 240 centers across 23 states Smile Care Foundation is not just reaching the children but also the communities in which the children live. Through regular interactions parents are sensitized about the need and importance of education for boys and girls, abolishing child labor, opting for healthier habits. Community mobilizers and volunteers regularly visit these children to check on their progress and extra classes are provided to those students who face difficulties with their lessons. When schools were shut down to stop the spread of Covid-19, teachers from Mission Education children ensured through their hard-work and dedication that no child was left behind in their journey of learning. Parents were taught to assist their children to attend online classes. In remote rural areas of states like Rajasthan, West Bengal and Karnataka where people belonged to the most underserved sections cluster classes were introduced for children to continue their education. 
        The importance of educational NGOs in India like Smile Care Foundation is immense as NGOs can change the face of India in the fields of primary and secondary education. It is the duty of every member of the society to contribute to the cause to make the initiatives of the NGOs successful and enable change in the society.</p>
